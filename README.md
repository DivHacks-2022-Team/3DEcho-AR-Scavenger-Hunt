# 3DEcho-AR-Scavenger-Hunt
DivHacks project over 48 hours to curate augmented reality game on echo3D. 
AR Scavenger Hunt around Columbia with a potential to be used during New Student Orientation Program or when entertaining visiting guests

Source: Echo3D
Idea dump: 
An AR “quest” platform -> basically randomly spawns predetermined paths for the plots depending on the map
AR Scavenger Hunt around Columbia
Potential to be used and educate during NSOP and visiting guests 

Content (required AR models):
Keyholder (use the keys found together with the notes to unlock, and get the next steps)
Key
Note with a prompt (10 in total)
Once found, can be “collected” to the “inventory” by the user, in order to view it later on
Interface for the inventory (where the notes and keys are stored)
Trophy ( you won!) ( only given if 10 keys and 10 notes are collected)
